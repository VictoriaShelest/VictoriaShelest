## Hey, I'm Victoria Shelest ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a motion graphics designer who turns complex ideas into visuals that communicate, guide attention, and tell stories while feeling clear, dynamic, and memorable. Over the past 15+ years in digital design, Iâ€™ve collaborated with marketing, product, VFX production, and live event teamsâ€”contributing to projects ranging from marketing campaigns and SaaS explainers to broadcast visuals and screen graphics for TV series. 

My focus is on making motion both communicative and systematic: brand-coherent animations, cross-platform alignment, and smarter workflows in After Effects powered by expressions and automation. That means less repetitive work, more creative freedom, and visuals that scale seamlessly.

Alongside projects, I enjoy exploring new workflow tricks that make motion design less overwhelming and more fun.
